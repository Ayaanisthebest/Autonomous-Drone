await drone.emergency_landing()
# Monitor altitude until safe landing
# Disarm immediately after landing
```

### Signal Loss Response
```python
# Automatic RTL on signal loss
if signal_lost:
    await drone.return_to_launch()
    # Wait for manual reconnection
```

### Battery Emergency
```python
# Low battery response
if battery_level < 20:
    await drone.return_to_launch()
elif battery_level < 10:
    await drone.emergency_landing()
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Drone Won't Arm
**Symptoms**: Motors don't spin, arming fails
**Possible Causes**:
- Safety checks failed
- GPS not locked
- Compass not calibrated
- Battery voltage too low

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check safety parameters
# Verify GPS lock (minimum 6 satellites)
# Recalibrate compass
# Check battery voltage
```

#### 2. Unstable Flight
**Symptoms**: Oscillations, drifting, poor control
**Possible Causes**:
- PID values too aggressive
- Vibration from motors/props
- Sensor calibration issues
- Frame damage

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Reduce PID values (start with 50% of default)
# Balance props and check motor mounting
# Recalibrate sensors
# Check frame for damage
```

#### 3. Person Detection Issues
